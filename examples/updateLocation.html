This is a really simple script that shows you how to change your location. <br>
Replace <YourToken> with the token generated in the login.html example.<br>
<Lat> and <Lon> are only needed if you want to appear in a specific geographic location. Otherwise use zeros to be earth.<br>
You can put anything you want but there is a display character limit of like 20 characters. You're only change Country value.
<br><br>
			<form action="http://ws.anomo.com/v210/index.php/webservice/user/update_user_location/<YourToken>/<Lat>/<Lon>" method="post">
			Location
			<input type="text" name="Country"><br>
			<button type="submit" >Change Location</button>
<br><br>
The resulting response from Anomo should be JSON formated data. You can copy the text and paste it into <a href="jsonviewer.stack.hu">jsonviewer.stack.hu</a> for viewing in a prettier format.</center>
