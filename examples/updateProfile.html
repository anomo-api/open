This is a really simple script that shows you all the fields you can update on your profile.<br>
Grabbing the token from the login.html example and replacing the <YourToken> in each of the forms will let you update them.<br>
Each field is case sensitive as spelt by the bolded text.<br>
<br>
All of these use the http://ws.anomo.com/v210/index.php/webservice/user/update/<YourToken> endpoint. Use the <br>updateAvatar.html example to update the avatars. Location is a different endpoint that I'll add an example for. Other fields in the response are not modifiable, like IsAdmin or Credits.
<br><br>
			<form action="http://ws.anomo.com/v208/index.php/webservice/user/update/<YourToken>" method="post">
			<b>UserName</b>. This has to be uppercase A through Z and 0 through 9. They don't allowe special <br>
			characters anymore and filter for swears in names. It used to not care how long you made your name but stopped<br> <bdisplaying it after 256 characters. Mr. A and I used to have dozens of accounts in our testing that would look<br> exactly the same because of the display characters visible but the ends were off by a couple characters that no one<br> would ever see. You can only change your username once ever calendar<br>
			month. That means if you changed your username on the 15th you won't be able to change it until the 16th.<br>
			<input type="text" name="UserName">	<button type="submit" >Change Username</button> 
<br><br>
			<form action="http://ws.anomo.com/v208/index.php/webservice/user/update/<YourToken>" method="post">
			<b>Password</b> can be anything you want as long as it's in MD5 encrypted format. I guess if you're just using<br> the api that you could just use plain text passwords but note that the app itself encrypts it to MD5 when it <br> sends so it wouldn't match if you logged in using the app.<br>
			<input type="text" name="Password">	<button type="submit" >Change Password</button>
<br><br>
			<form action="http://ws.anomo.com/v208/index.php/webservice/user/update/<YourToken>" method="post">
			<b>BirthDate</b> formatted with YYYY-MM-DD you can set it to any date and it will calculate based on that year.<br>
			<input type="text" name="BirthDate">	<button type="submit" >Change Birthday</button>
<br><br>
			<form action="http://ws.anomo.com/v208/index.php/webservice/user/update/<YourToken>" method="post">
			<b>AboutMe</b> limited to about 175 characters you can put any text in here that you'd like. You can use<pre>\n</pre> to add carriage returns.<br>
			<input type="text" name="AboutMe">	<button type="submit" >Change AboutMe</button>
<br><br>
			<form action="http://ws.anomo.com/v208/index.php/webservice/user/update/<YourToken>" method="post">
			<b>Gender</b> 1 represents female, 2 represents male, and 0 doesn't change your gender but returns an <br>
			error on the avatar screen, because the server returns {"code":"INVALID_REQUEST"}.<br>
			<input type="text" name="Gender">	<button type="submit" >Change Gender</button>
<br><br>
			<form action="http://ws.anomo.com/v208/index.php/webservice/user/update/<YourToken>" method="post">
			<b>FacebookID</b> This used to show the users FacebookID if they had verified with FB. Now it shows a 1 if it is.<br> You should still be able to use this field to update your FBid on file so if you want to move your fb login to<br> another account you'd update this field. This can come in handy for verifying an account with FB and just move <br> it around as you need. Remember to always have a password set to the account.<br>
			<input type="text" name="Gender">	<button type="submit" >Change Gender</button>
<br><br>
			<form action="http://ws.anomo.com/v208/index.php/webservice/user/update/<YourToken>" method="post">
			<b>CoverPicture</b> this is based on a file uploaded to the s3 bucket. You can upload to it using the revealUpload<br> example and use that image file to update this field. I'm not sure of the size specifications since i didn't <br>really use this much.<br>
			<input type="text" name="CoverPicture">	<button type="submit" >Change Gender</button>

The resulting response from Anomo should be JSON formated data. You can copy the text and paste it into <a href="jsonviewer.stack.hu">jsonviewer.stack.hu</a> for viewing in a prettier format.</center>
