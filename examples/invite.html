This is a really lazy and simple example of how to use the invite function to increase your user points.<br>
Since they don't validate numbers, for international reasons, you can pass any numeric value to the invite service to count.<b>
The invite.php generates numbers based on an area code you provide, to look more legit, but anything will work.<br>
Invite.php calculates the number of points the user has and subtracts it from 130,000 to determine how many points the <br>
user is missing from getting a Fan Page. It then generates that many phone numbers, rounded up, to invite.<br>
You can have any number of consecutive entries as long as they're separated by a semi colon ";".<br>
As per usual, replace <YourToken> with the token generated when you used login.html.
<br><br>
			<form action="http://ws.anomo.com/v209/index.php/webservice/invite_friend/sms/<YourToken>" method="post">
			<br>Numbers<br>
			<input type="text" name="PhoneNumbers" size="20"><br><br>
			<button type="submit" >Invite</button>
<br><br>
The resulting response from Anomo should be JSON formated data. You can copy the text and paste it into <a href="jsonviewer.stack.hu">jsonviewer.stack.hu</a> for viewing in a prettier format.</center>
