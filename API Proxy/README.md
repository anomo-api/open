This some playwork I'd done at building an api proxy. It's pretty cumbersome in terms of how I built it and lacks any sort of framework for it. 

Basically it accepts values, retrieves the content, parses the json and spits out json with what I felt was really necessary for that call and remove some other details like lat and lon values or DOBs from profiles and posts.
