This is a bunch of unofficial api stuff for Anomo.com that I've done. It includes a new half-assed client update from the last one, half-assed oldclient to their mobile app as well as some addons like an avatar changer and some simple bots. 

I've sanatized some of the details and too lazy to add the db details and most of it isn't commented. 

If you really have questions about any of it you can email me at nason000 at gmail.com but I can't promise that I'll respond.

You can find more details in the wiki.

You can see a demo of the current state of the new half-assed client <a href="http://anomo.online/site">HERE</a>
