				<h2>
					Hello.
				</h2>
				<p>
					Welcome to the Unofficial Anomo API.<br>
					The purpose of the API is provide users with a programatic way of interacting with Anomo. Based on the original API that the app uses, the Unofficial API actually accesses the official API and returns results with scrubbed data.<br><br>
					
					<b>Why have you provided an API for Anomo</b><br>
					Mostly because I was getting bored being the only one developing stuff that interacted with Anomo.</br><br>
					
					<b>Why wouldn't you just provide documentation for the actual API?</b><br>
					There's a lot of extra data included with the API results that have stayed behind over the versions. Explaining all the elements would be a lot of detail that wouldn't be needed. Additionally, it strips some of the more personal data that the API reports.<br><br>
					
					<b>Does Anomo have any affiliation to this project</b><br>
					Absolutely not. This is in no way associated with Anomo Inc. what so ever.<br><br>
